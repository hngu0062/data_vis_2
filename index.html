			<p><span class="aus">Australia</span> is a rich and vibrant country comprising <span class="culture">many ethnic groups</span> within its population.
				<br>
				<br>
				The <span class="aus">overwhelming majority of Australians speak English</span> (almost <b>93%</b> as of 2016), 
				which is the official national language of Australia.
				Only a few other countries around the world match that statistic, most notably, the United Kingdom, New Zealand 
				and the United States of America, which are all considered to be Western and developed like Australia.

			<p>So where is this acclaimed diversity in Australia?
				<br>
				<br>
				At first glance, it may not seem that a country with such a dominant language would have much cultural variety.
				<br>
				<br>
				However, <b>census data</b> from within the past two decades shows that this is, indeed, the case.
				<br>
				<br>
				Below is an interactive visualisation of the <span class="culture">20 most common languages</span> other than English (LOTE) and <span class="culture">ancestries</span>
				among <span class="aus">Australians</span>.

			<p class="left_col">It appears that the <span class="aus">bigger city areas of Australia</span> tend to have the <span class="culture">highest proportion known of multilinguals</span>, 
				with both New South Wales and Victoria having <b>almost 30%</b> of their respective populations claiming to be able to 
				speak another language. 
				<br>
				<br>
				The <b>same languages make up the top 6 in both states</b> as well as for the umbrella category of greater capital cities, 
				but in different orders.
				<br>
				These are: 
				<ul>
					<li>Mandarin</li>
					<li>Cantonese</li>
					<li>Arabic</li>
					<li>Vietnamese</li>
					<li>Italian</li>
					<li>Greek</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p class="left_col">
				The <span class="aus">Northern Territory</span> sports an even <span class="culture">larger fraction of multilingual people</span>, if only by a sliver.
				<br>
				<br>
				Unlike the other states, however, the most commonly spoken LOTE there are Australian Indigenous languages, by 
				a landslide.
				<br>
				<br>
				One thing to bear in mind in the face of this information is that the NT is <b>not densely populated</b>, only having 
				about 225,000 people, so the cultural demographic of the NT is not as representative of the wider Australian 
				demographic as the aforementioned big cities, which have individual populations in excess of 5 million.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="pure-u-1-3">
			<p class="right_col">
				Across all available times and areas, the <span class="culture">number of multilingual people</span> who are <span class="aus">sufficiently proficient in English</span> 
				dwarfs the number of those <b>who are not</b>. This would explain why Australia has such a high percentage of English-speakers
				while accommodating a wide range of backgrounds and cultures.
				<br>
				<br>
				In recent years, there has been a <span class="culture">boom in the prevalence of East and Southeast Asian languages</span> across the board, 
				especially Mandarin Chinese, rivalling or even overtaking the established Italian and Greek populations. Again, this 
				is more of a characteristic of the bigger cities.
				<br>
				<br>
				Unsurprisingly, the areas with relatively <b>high proportions</b> of <span class="aus">Australian, English, Irish or Scottish ancestry</span> also 
				have the <b>highest proportion</b> of <span class="aus">people who only speak English</span>. Tasmania, Queensland and Regional Australia stand out 
				in this regard.
				<br>
				<br>
				Another interesting and perhaps unexpected observation to make here is the very recent overtaking of Australian 
				ancestry by those with an English background. On the other hand, we can see that both populations have been 
				neck-in-neck at the top of the list for at least decades, so this almost nation-wide occurrence may simply be a 
				coincidence.

				By using the slider to vary time, it is clear that Australia's population has not only been growing in absolute 
				value, but also in <span class="culture">cultural diversity</span>, as the proportion of <span class="aus">monolingual English-speakers</span> to <span class="culture">multilingual people</span> has 
				been diminishing.
				<br>
				<br>
				The next question to ask is, "Is this is reflected in <span class="birth">migration data</span>?"

				The answer is a resounding "yes".
				<br>
				<br>
				As could be expected, the <span class="birth">most common overseas birthplace is the United Kingdom</span>, consistent with our observation 
				from the ancenstry census data. New Zealand also ranks quite highly in all. This would account for a large chunk of 
				the top non-Australian, predominantly <span class="aus">English-speaking ancestries</span>.
				<br>
				<br>
				Once again, we see the <span class="culture">East and Southeast Asian</span> identities catching up to the established <span class="culture">European communities</span>, if 
				not outright overtaking them in number.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="pure-u-1-3">
			<br>
			<p class="right_col">
				We also see that the <span class="birth">percentage of Australians born overseas has been increasing</span> over time in all areas since 2001.
				Tasmania and Regional Australia, two of the most remote areas in consideration, which were both shown to have 
				relatively high monolingual English-speaking populations, are lagging behind the rest in this development.
				<br>
				<br>
				Overall, the proportion of Australians who were <span class="birth">born overseas</span> in 2016 (26.3%) has <span class="birth">increased by about 4.5%</span> since 2001 
				(21.8%)
